DANGEROUS :

- (see TODO list)
- ...

SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM :

- Do not handle H flag
- DAA instruction not perfect
- EI and DI instructions take effect immediately (instead of after their execution)
- HALT instruction is not bugged when DI, then : no opcode dupliaction
- background drawn each frame, not on each line

MAN ERROR ? :

- RST instruction should push actual address on stack, but I push next inst addr instead
